In second section Naive Implementation of Estimator is given and is shown to be extremely slow by profilling. Thereafter two efficient implementations are suggested that obtains about **110X** and **140X** Improvement in Efficiency. Also,  **4X** improvement is obtained over current implementaion in `geomstats` in fundamental task of computing GL-invariant distance  between batches of SPD matrices. In third section, A detailed Ablation study is conducted"
